                <p>My working life, so far, has been spent selling computers, stereos, home theatre and all manner of tech goods.
                    I have learnt much about teamwork, what people want, and how to satisfy those needs.</br>
                    I have just completed a Software Engineering degree at Massey University and
                    in this new chapter of my life I intend to take all the things I have learnt at Massey, and in life, and apply them to a new career in software development.

                <p>In 2011 I helped a friend open a new, very successful stereo shop in Mt Eden called AV World.
                    One of my key responsibilities was to develop and grow our online business.
                    It was during this time that I developed a real interest in software development.
